#   ⚠ DESTRUCTIVE, AND MEANT TO BE. Run it on a THROWAWAY host you can format.

#     about.

#
# THE TREE UNDER TEST IS THIS CHECKOUT, always. The drill installs box by running
# the install.sh beside it against the working tree, and no flag points it
# anywhere else: to drill a branch, check that branch out (#225). It used to take
# a repository and a ref and install over the network, so the harness came from
# your checkout and the subject came from main — standing on a branch and running
# the two lines above drilled a tree nobody was reading.
#
# A DIRTY WORKTREE IS REFUSED, and so is a run as root: the record names the
# commit, which an uncommitted edit makes a lie, and box installs by uid, which
# only a non-root drill has ever exercised. --allow-dirty runs a dirty tree
# anyway and stamps the record's ref field '-dirty' — a record that cannot be
# reproduced says so on its face.
#
# The run is short unless it emits at least the expected number of verdicts:
# a phase that never executed used to report a clean sweep (#153). A skip that
# is legitimate prints a SKIP line and lowers the floor by exactly its probes.
#
# --emit-record <path> writes drills/README.md's six-item record with every
# field the harness already knows filled in (#152): the run ID, the host, the
# repository, branch and commit MEASURED from this checkout, the numbers
# against #153's
# floor, the wall clock, the findings and the isolation audit answers, all
# uncoloured (#154). It is a SKELETON — what
# a failure means for the release is a judgement a script must not fabricate,
# so the file says it is a draft until you edit that line out. --run-id (or
# DRILL_RUN_ID) pins the ID this release set's three records share; unset, it
# generates drill-<version>-<date>-01, and either way it is printed early
# enough to hand to whoever drills rig and cast.
#
# NO_COLOR (any value), or a stdout that is not a terminal, drops the ANSI.
# The summary exists to be piped somewhere; escape codes in a pasted record
# are noise, and every record before this one was transcribed past them.
#
# The phases, in the order they PRINT. The letter is the phase's ledger key and
# the bracketed number is how many verdicts a complete run of it owes (#153):
#   I. The installer's contract — the stack install.sh left, asserted before
#      anything else here touches it (#64).                                 [1]
#   A. Incus semantics — the assumptions box is built on, probed directly.
#      These were only ever verified against a stub.                        [8]
#   B. The box surface — the whole CLI, end to end, including the boundary. [45]
#   C. Isolation baseline — does the trust boundary actually hold?

#   E. box expose — a deliberate loopback door, opened and shut (#55).      [7]
#   D. The isolation contract, STATED — not rehearsed. What it used to apply
#      live is shipped, so C tests the real stack and a run leaves no
#      D-phase mutations behind.                                           [0]
#   M. Migration — the pre-0.4.0 → box transition (host/migrate-host.sh).  [10]
#   T. Teardown — every box the drill minted is gone, and only those.       [1]
#
# Exit 0 = every check passed AND the run was not short of that floor (#153).
# The summary ends with the isolation audit answers; --emit-record carries them
# into the record, which is where they are read now (#154).

# There is no --repo and no --ref, and no environment pass-through behind them:

# before install.sh copies anything — and then carried. These five cross the sg
# re-exec like every other pin because the shell that writes the record is not
# the shell that took the measurement.
#

# that exists to catch bad record paths early (#152).
#
# So nothing is interpolated. `sg` execs with the environment intact, which is
# how --in-group has always got its settings across; the -c string is now a fixed

# drills/README.md asks a record for six things, and this harness knew five of

# by hand out of ANSI-coloured terminal output at the end of a forty-minute run,
# by someone who then had to reconstruct what the host had been. The sixth — the
# run ID that makes box's, rig's and cast's records reassemble into one picture —
# had no mechanism at all: it was invented at write-up time, independently, three
# times, and the odds the three matched were whatever memory was worth.
#
# The split is the whole design. record_collect() touches the world (uname,
# incus, /etc/os-release, the network) and record_write() touches nothing but
# the REC_* set, so the SHAPE of a record is drivable by a test on a host with
# no Incus, no drill and no network.
#
# What the harness must never write is prose. "Judged not release-blocking: it
# affects teardown residue on a host that is about to be wiped" is a judgement,
# and a generated file that reads like a finished one is worse than no file at
# all — it invites exactly the transcription-free confidence the last two

# /opt/box, the verification file it read never existed, and the mismatch fired
# a FATAL that told the operator their local drill.sh was stale — a confidently

# The one moment the tree's identity has an answer (round 2, #225).
#
# A record describes what was INSTALLED AND DRILLED, and install.sh copies the
# tree in stage 1, forty minutes before the record is written. Every field
# describing the tree used to re-ask git at summary time instead, and by then
# git is answering about a different tree than the one in the box. The
# reproduced case: a run starts dirty under --allow-dirty, the operator stashes
# or commits during the drill, and collection reads a clean checkout — so the
# record names a branch with no '-dirty' stamp and drops --allow-dirty from the
# line that claims to reproduce it, while the installed tree still holds the
# uncommitted work that actually ran. A record naming a commit anyone can check
# out and that is NOT what ran is the exact untruth #225 closes, re-entered
# through the one door left open. The SHA and the ref go the same way for the
# same reason: a mid-run commit or branch switch moves both.
#
# So the tree is read ONCE, here, before anything is installed, and the answers
# are latched. An already-set TREE_DIRTY is the stage-1 measurement arriving over
# the sg re-exec, and re-answering any of this in the second stage is the defect
# itself. The dirty PATHS are latched with the flag, because the NOTE that names
# them is raised in that second stage and git cannot be asked for them there.

# THE BYTES THAT LANDED (round 4, #225). Everything above watches the SOURCE: the
# tree is measured, measured again on both sides of the install, and refused if
# the two answers differ. Two equal endpoints do not make a constant interval.
# install.sh reads the checkout ACROSS that gap, so a change made after the first
# verify and reverted before the second is copied into the box and then made
# invisible to the only thing looking. codex reproduced exactly that with a `tar`
# shim: both witnesses matched, INSTALLED_FROM was right, the checkout ended with
# no marker in it, and the installed README.md had one.
#
# No check on the source closes that, because the source is not the subject. What
# the record claims is about the COPY, so the copy is what gets attested: every
# file the installer copies, on both sides, by content. That catches a divergence
# whatever produced it — a race, a shim, a truncated tar, an install that fell
# back to another tree — without anticipating any of them, and it is the one
# comparison whose subject is the bytes the drill is about to run.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT compare, each because it is not payload:
#   · .git ANYWHERE in the tree. install.sh's `tar --exclude=.git`
#     (install.sh:213) is an unanchored pattern, so it matches any path
#     component and a vendored repository is never copied; pruning only the
#     top-level one would red an install that was faithful (round 5, #225);
#   · INSTALLED_FROM, which the installer WRITES into the version directory —
#     the installer's own note about itself, asserted separately just above;
#   · file MODES: install.sh chmods bin/box +x deliberately, and a mode is not
#     a byte the drill runs;
#   · empty directories, which carry no bytes either.
#
# THE MANIFEST IS NUL-DELIMITED, AND IT IS A FILE (round 5, #225). This began as
# one `<path> <hash>` LINE per file, and a newline is legal in a path, so the
# line could not say where a record ended: codex built a source whose only file
# sat under a directory named `a <hash-of-alpha>` + newline + `.` against a
# destination holding top-level `a` and `b`, and the two printed the SAME
# listing. Different payloads, identical verdict, on the one check whose whole
# claim is that these bytes are those bytes. Three NUL-terminated fields per
# record — kind, value, path — so no field can contain its own delimiter, and
# the path goes last because it is the field with the fewest guarantees. It has
# to be a file rather than a string because bash drops NUL bytes from a command
# substitution, which is what left the ambiguous encoding as the only option.

# >>> ledger summary (#153) — test/cli.sh extracts this block verbatim, down to
# and INCLUDING the exit gate at the end of the file, and executes it. Grepping
# for the shortfall verdict proves only that the line is written; #153's whole
# criterion is an EXIT STATUS, so the exit status is what has to be driven. Keep
# the block self-contained: it may assume the verdict helpers, the ledger and
# the record block above it — all three are extracted alongside it — plus the
# four settings the record needs from around it: RECORD and KEEP off the command
# line, CHECKOUT off the script's own path and BOX_SHARE off the uid (#225).

# in the '?' bucket, deliberately, and the per-phase line is already printed by
# the time it fires. What it does move is `fail`, which is the point — a short
# run leaves here non-zero.
