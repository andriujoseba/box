# doctor.sh — is this host fit to mint boxes (and to drill), and if not, what
# is wrong? Users reach it as 'box doctor'; the drill runs it directly.
#
#   bash drill/doctor.sh          # report
#   bash drill/doctor.sh --fix    # report, then restore what is missing, delete leftovers
#
# --fix has two halves because a host goes wrong in two ways.
#
#   · A RUN LEFT THINGS BEHIND. An aborted drill leaves its boxes (drill,
#     clone, archive, peer, payroll, cbprobe, cbcopy, cbnotours), and an
#     interrupted multiuser.sh leaves its rehearsal users and their projects.
#     --fix deletes the boxes and names the users' own cleanup.
#   · THE HOST IS MISSING SHIPPED STACK PIECES. dns.mode=none, the box-isolate
#     ACL and a gateway carve-out that tracks the live bridge,
#     security.port_isolation on the NIC, a dnsmasq actually serving boxnet.
#     Their ABSENCE is the fault, never their presence, and --fix puts them
#     back.
#
# Either way the host mints boxes on a broken network, and that is not a
# hypothetical. It is how a box came up with no DNS at all
# ("Temporary failure resolving deb.debian.org" in cloud-init), and how a false
# design veto against #16 got posted from a poisoned baseline. A verdict
# measured on a broken baseline is not a verdict, which is why this file exists.
#
# This script is the answer to "what state is the host actually in?" — the
