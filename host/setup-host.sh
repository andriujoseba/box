# --- The subnet: never build on one something already owns ------------------
# (#80.) The stack's subnet was hardcoded, and running setup-host INSIDE a box
# gave the guest a nested boxnet claiming the exact subnet and gateway of its
# own uplink: the guest then held its gateway's address as a LOCAL address,
# carried two connected routes for the subnet, and suffered intermittent,
# self-recovering egress blackouts nobody could attribute — the host looked
# clean the whole time. The flagship use case funnels agents toward doing
# exactly this (working on box, in a box), so the decision must happen BEFORE
# any mutation. An explicit BOX_SUBNET is honored or refused, never overridden;
# with no pin, choose_subnet below converges on an existing bridge or picks a
# free /24 itself — a drill inside a box now just works, zero flags.

# BOX_SUBNET must be a /24 with a zero host octet — a.b.c.0/24. Everything
# the stack derives (the bridge address, the gateway carve-out, the firewall)
# assumes that shape, and a garbage value must die HERE, never inside an
# incus create or an nft rule.

# The one place the stack's subnet is decided. Four deliberate cases (#80's
# fix #1, completed — the refusal shipped first, this adds the auto-pick):
#   1. explicit BOX_SUBNET       — use it; a foreign claimant or a disagreeing
#      bridge still REFUSES. An operator's pin is never silently overridden:
#      a script that says 10.90 gets 10.90 or a loud stop, never a surprise.
#   2. no pin, boxnet exists     — converge to the bridge's own subnet: the
#      bridge IS the pin (boxes hold leases on it; setup-host never
#      re-addresses it). What used to be an agree-gate refusal on a bare
#      re-run against a moved bridge is now plain convergence. A FOREIGN
#      claimant on the bridge's own subnet still refuses — that is #80's
#      poisoned state, and converging would rebuild on it.
#   3. no pin, no bridge, 10.88.0.0/24 free — the default, as always.
#   4. no pin, no bridge, default claimed   — the nested case (a drill or
#      rehearsal inside a box): scan 10.89.0.0/24 … 10.127.0.0/24 in order,
#      take the first free candidate, and say so loudly; refuse only when
#      EVERY candidate is claimed. The scan only ever runs bridge-less —
#      an existing bridge is case 2, which precedes it.
# Prints the chosen subnet on stdout, explains itself on stderr, fails when
# it refuses. Everything downstream (BOX_GW, the bridge, the ACL carve-out,
# the firewall, the doctor's expectations) derives from the choice, which is

# several GB and minutes apiece once a box is provisioned, against a workflow
# whose whole point is "log in once, snapshot, clone forever" (#29). btrfs on
# a loop device gives CoW (near-instant, near-free clones) with no
# partitioning. The preseed mirrors exactly what --minimal creates (pool,
# incusbr0, default profile) with only the driver deliberate; dir remains the
# fallback so a host that cannot do btrfs still works — just slowly, and it
# says so.
#
# WHERE that pool lives is a second decision, independent of the driver (#180).
# With no 'source:' key Incus creates the pool inside its own state directory,
# /var/lib/incus/storage-pools/default — on the root filesystem. Every box's
# root device then sits in that loop-backed image, so the disk a template asks
# for (BOX_DISK, 60GiB by default) is charged against '/', and a whole fleet
# competes with the operating system for one partition. BOX_STORAGE_SOURCE is
# that placement and it is passed through to 'source:' VERBATIM: Incus reads a
# block device (/dev/sdb — formatted and owned outright, the recommended form)
# and a path on an already-mounted filesystem (/data/bulk/incus — shared with
# whatever else is there) through the same key, and this script telling the two
# apart would only be guessing at what Incus already knows. Unset emits no
# 'source:' line at all, so an upgraded host keeps byte-for-byte the pool it
# has. Placement is HOST state, decided once with the pool, which is why it is
# a setup-host variable and not a 'box new' flag — box new owns no resize verb
# for the same reason (docs/box-design.md).

# The preseed's storage_pools block, composed in one place so test/cli.sh can
# drive every driver/source combination against it — and so the unset case is
# provably the same bytes it has always been.
#
# The source is a SINGLE-QUOTED YAML scalar, never a plain one. A plain scalar
# ends at ' #', YAML's comment marker, so '/data/bulk/a #archive' — a legal
# directory name and a legal Incus source — would reach the daemon as
# '/data/bulk/a', and where that prefix exists the pool is built somewhere
# nobody named, silently. That is exactly the defect #180 came to close,
# arriving through the front door instead. Quoting is also what makes the
# pass-through VERBATIM rather than nearly: inside single quotes every
# character is literal and only a quote needs escaping, by doubling it. The
# alternative — refusing such a value at the gate — would make this script the
# thing standing between the operator and a placement Incus accepts, which is
# the guessing the pass-through exists to avoid.

# Is the live pool already at the requested source? Pure — requested, live,
# initial and what the request resolves to NOW in, exit status out — so
# test/cli.sh drives it directly.
#
# Two sources, because Incus keeps two. Handed a BLOCK DEVICE, the btrfs driver
# records what you gave it in 'volatile.initial_source', formats the device,
# then OVERWRITES 'source' with the new filesystem's UUID — a bare UUID, not a
# path (lxc/incus@90429bf, driver_btrfs.go). So a host set up with
# BOX_STORAGE_SOURCE=/dev/sdb reports 'source: 4ff9…' ever after, and reading
# live 'source' alone would make every re-run of the documented block-device
# form fire the migration refusal below at the pool it had just correctly
# placed. The 'dir' driver sets no initial source and mangles nothing, so the
# fall back to live 'source' is not a courtesy for old pools — it is the only
# correct read for that driver, and for every path-shaped source.
#
# But an initial source is a STRING RECORDED ONCE, at creation, and it was
# being used as proof of what a path names TODAY. Those are different facts,
# and they come apart the first time the kernel enumerates disks in a different
# order — a reboot, an added controller, a hot-plug. Then '/dev/sdb' is disk B
# while the pool is still on disk A, and the documented identical invocation
# used to answer "already placed there" about a disk it is not on: D3's silence
# wearing a success message (panel round 3). So where live 'source' is NOT a
# path — i.e. it is the UUID btrfs wrote after formatting a device — the
# historical string is proof only if the path still resolves to that
# filesystem. Where live 'source' IS a path, or absent, Incus mangled nothing,
# the string is the answer, and the textual comparison stands unchanged: every
# 'dir' pool, every mounted-path source.
#
# Three outcomes, because there are three facts: 0 placed, 1 placed somewhere
# else entirely, 2 made from this path but the path is not that disk now (or
# cannot be shown to be). 1 and 2 both refuse, and they refuse differently.
